## Documentation

[Documents](/DOCUMENTS/)

## Requirements

- [**Docker and Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

- _For development mode:_
  - _Node.js_
  - _NPM_
  - _MariaDB or MySQL_

## Deployment

**Getting started is easy. Just follow these steps:**

Docker and Docker Compose are required for deployment.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrayDeveloper/edulib.git
cd edulib
```

Rename `example.env` files as the templates:

`./BACKEND/.env`

`./FRONTEND/.env`

**You don't need to change any environment variables, for the default setup using Docker!**

Deploy using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will launch:

- Frontend (Next.js)
- Backend (Express.js)
- Database (MariaDB)
- NGINX reverse proxy

On the first run, Docker will build the images and set up the containers. This may take a few minutes.

After the initial setup, you can access the application at `http://localhost` or the configured domain or `your computer's IP address` (if you are using a local network).

**The default credentials for the admin account is setted by environment** variables, the password is randomly generated, and will be printed in the backend console.

## Custom domain

If you want to use local domain under windowds, you need to add the following line to your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file with this command:

```bash
echo 127.0.0.1 edulib.hu >> %WINDIR%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts
```

In this example, the domain is `edulib.hu`, but you can change it to any domain you want. Just make sure to update the environment variables accordingly.

## Development mode

Configure your environment variables, using the provided `example.env` files as templates: `./BACKEND/.env` `./FRONTEND/.env`

In development mode, the backend and frontend services are run separately. This allows for hot reloading and easier debugging. But it requires Node.js and NPM to be installed on your machine.

Also you need to have a running MariaDB or MySQL server. You can use _XAMPP_ or a Docker-based database.

Clone the repo and install dependencies for each service:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrayDeveloper/edulib.git
cd edulib
```

```bash
cd BACKEND
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd FRONTEND
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have a running MariaDB or MySQL server. You can use _XAMPP_ or a Docker-based database.
